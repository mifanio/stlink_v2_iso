# stlink_v2_iso
üîå ST-Link V2 ISO (Type-C, Dual Isolation, External Power)

This project is an isolated version of the ST-Link V2 based on the STM32F103CBT6 microcontroller, designed for safe programming and debugging of STM32 and other ARM-compatible MCUs.

Its main feature is the use of two galvanic isolation barriers and the ability to power the target device directly from the programmer via USB Type-C.
